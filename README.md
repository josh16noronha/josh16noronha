<h1 align="center">I am Joshua Noronha</h1>
<h2>👋 About Me!</h2>
I am currently a fourth-year Software Engineering university student who is passionate about finding and exploring solutions to complex problems. My programming journey began in high school when I took my first web development course, where I learned PHP, HTML, and CSS to create my initial website for the AutoShop class. The concept of the website was to facilitate communication between the client and the teacher, allowing them to coordinate on costs and discuss potential car fixes needed. To implement this communication, I connected the website to the Gmail API so that a pre-existing system could handle the communication. Ever since then, I've been delving deeper and expanding my knowledge in the realm of software development, by working on more projects.

<h2>🚀 Student Life!</h2>
As a student, I have explored various aspects of software engineering, ranging from algorithms and data structures to fulstack development. My coursework has provided me with a robust foundation in languages such as Java, Python, and C. I have also have experience and a better understanding of creating UML diagrams. Additionally, I have deepened my understanding of computer architecture, delving into components like the kernel, and exploring the intricacies of process scheduling through the scheduler, utilizing methods such as round-robin and others. Overall as a student, I've discovered a constant eagerness to learn and adapt within the ever-evolving landscape of technology, embracing a pursuit of continuous improvement.

<h2>🌐 My GitHub Repositories!</h2>
